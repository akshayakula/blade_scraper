  "summary": "The VA Visual Impairment and Orientation and Mobility Professionals Scholarship Program (VIOMPSP) Agreement is a contract between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and a scholarship recipient. The VA, represented by the Under Secretary for Health (USH), agrees to provide the participant with a scholarship award covering tuition and required fees up to $15,000 per academic year, and will assist the participant in obtaining necessary certifications and employment upon graduation. The participant, in return, is required to pursue a degree in a qualifying field of education, maintain enrollment and academic standing, inform the VA of any changes in their situation, and complete all coursework within a specified time frame. The participant also agrees to serve a period of obligated service as a full-time employee in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for three calendar years. The agreement also outlines penalties for breach of agreement, such as failure to accept payment, maintain academic standing, or complete the period of obligated service. It also includes provisions for cancellation, suspension, and waiver of obligation due to special circumstances. The agreement also requires the participant's consent for the release of information about their academic performance."
